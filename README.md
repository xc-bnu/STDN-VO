# STDN-VO: Spatiotemporal Dual-stream Network for Visual Odometry

# Evaluation
We trained the model on sequences 00-10 and subsequently tested it on sequences 11-21. The results were submitted to the KITTI official website for testing. Figures illustrate the trajectories and corresponding error plots for sequences 11-15, which are exclusively shown on the KITTI website.
